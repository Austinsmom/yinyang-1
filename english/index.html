	<h2>No need for programing. HTML is directly generated by HTML files.</h2>

		YinYang is a client side template and framework.
It collates documents and templates as well as data retrieved by Ajax etc, and renders it as a single page via JavaScript.
It doesn't need to be in a server side environment. The designer can focus on working on HTML without worrying about programming.</p>
	<h2>No more mockups needed. You can design on your template.</h2>
	<p>
		<img class="fig" src="../style/images/fig-nomockups.png" />
		Do you think that creating mock-ups and creating templates are two separate things? It's true that in many template engines, the template isn't in HTML.<br />
		When you display the template in web browser strange symbols are displayed, or it only displays one when you need to see several side by side to get a sense of the image.<br />
		With YinYang, the template itself in perfect HTML, so you can modify it with a visual editor (Dreamweaver etc).</p>
	<h2>No database needed. Just place your docs on your folder.</h2>
	<p>
		<img class="fig" src="../style/images/fig-nodb.png" />
		Searching for files on a server is one of the things you can't do with Javascript. YinYang provides a SQL-like query language that is specialized for HTML file searches.<br />
		<br />
		For example, if you need the three newest pages, just set it for<br />
		SELECT * FROM ./ LIMIT3.<br />
		*A server side PHP script environment is required to use the hSQL (html Search Query Language).</p>
