	<h2>No need for programing. HTML is directly generated by HTML files.</h2>

		YinYang is a template framework that helps your client-side coding.<br />
		It renders a page by merging documents, templates, and data in background.<br />
		And it can run on any server-side environment. So, front-end engineers and designers are able to focus on coding HTML without worrying about how back-end systems runs.</p>
	<h2>No more mockups needed. You can design on your template.</h2>
	<p>
		<img class="fig" src="../style/images/fig-nomockups.png" />
		Have you ever thought why you need to make mockups and templates separately? It's true that a template functions in a similar way to a html in most of template engines. However, rendering a template in web browser fails with showing not-familiar symbols with designers and HTML coders. So you might think if there were a way to render a template itself.<br />
		And here it is. With YinYang, the template functions not only a template in the engine, but also a html in any editors. So for example, you can directly render the template with a visual editor (DreamWeaver etc).</p>
	<h2>No database needed. Just place your docs on your folder.</h2>
	<p>

		Searching files in server is one of things that you can't do without Javascript. But YinYang provides you with a SQL-like language for searching such files. <br />
		To take an example, if you need the three newest pages, just type the following command.<br />
		<strong>SELECT * FROM ./ LIMIT 3</strong><br />
		* You need to have server-side scripting environment (PHP) to use hSQL (html Search Query Language).</p>
